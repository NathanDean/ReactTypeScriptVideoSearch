## What 

An React and TypeScript app that uses Axios to query the YouTube Data API and display results to the user. 

## Why 

I wanted to create an app to test my skills using an external API.  I was keen to use an API associated with a professional and widely used product, to get a better understanding of how data is structured on a complex platform.  I also decided to choose something with a link to the entertainment industry, given my own background and interests in this area.  The YouTube Data API therefore seemed like an ideal choice. 

## How 

I initially built the app in React with class components.  A while later, I took a course in TypeScript, and decided to practice my skills by going back and adding TypeScript to this project.  While doing this, I also replaced the class components with functional components, to be more in keeping with current React practices. 

While building the app, I spent some time reading the API docs to understand which pieces of data I needed from the response and how to access them.  The app also uses he to transform Unicode data from the API into a string, and also has some basic styling with CSS. 

## What I learnt 

By the end of this project, I had a much better understanding of how data from APIs can be structured and accessed, and how requests and responses work.  When I went back to the project and added TypeScript, I also had to learn about creating models to fit the data returned by the API, which improved my understanding of both TypeScript and APIs.
